## Buy/Sell Market Order

A **Market Order** is the simplest type of order.

- **Buy Market Order**: Instantly buys the desired amount of an item at the lowest available price.
- **Sell Market Order**: Instantly sells the item at the highest price currently offered by a buyer.

> ⚠️ *Market orders are executed immediately, but the price may vary depending on current supply and demand.*

### Example
If you place a **Buy Market Order** for 10 Iron Ingots:
- You’ll buy from the cheapest sellers available.
- If the lowest seller is at a higher price than the current market price, then you have to pay his price.
- If no one is selling, your order won’t be filled.

## Buy/Sell Limit Order

A **Limit Order** lets you set the exact price you're willing to buy or sell at.

- **Buy Limit Order**: You specify the maximum price you're willing to pay. The order will only be filled if a seller offers the item at that price or lower.
- **Sell Limit Order**: You specify the minimum price you're willing to accept. The order will only be filled if a buyer is willing to pay that price or more.

> 🕒 *Limit orders are not guaranteed to execute immediately. They stay on the market until matched or canceled.*
